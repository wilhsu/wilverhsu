                    Skin: Research Booklet (2023)
                    <br><br>
                    The Skin: Research Booklet is a 200+ page booklet that compiled 12 Wikipedia articles, all of which originated from the wikipedia page on “skin.” This was done as a research method that assisted my interested in different ways skin can be represented in the context of graphic design.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the idea of skin being anything on the exterior and everything else on the interior, the book is divided into interior/exterior sections. The interior parts of a spread consists of texts from Wikipedia, while the exterior parts consists of images that accompany the texts. 
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, the captions for the images are printed directly opposite of the printed images, on the other side of the paper. This is done so that the images/texts would be visible from one side under direct sunlight, mimicking the effects of subsurface scattering (light scattered when penetrating translucent objects) of the skin. 
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire book is also bounded with paperclips, indicating the orderless format of these wikipedia pages; an exploration done in one page could easily lead to the other, and the other, and so on. The boundless collation is also meant to represent the ubiquity of skin and how broad this topic extends to.
