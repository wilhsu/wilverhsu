                    In Defense of the Poor Image 
                    <br>
                    2023
                    <br><br>
                    In Defense of the Poor Image is a motion poster series made as a visual identity for a mock event for Hito Steyerl’s essay “In Defense of the Poor Image.” The essay makes an argument that there is an utmost cultural significance amongst images/videos with poor quality, especially in a day and age where low quality equates to low relevance.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking inspiration on pixelation and the contrast with what the modern world perceives as prominence, this poster series can be divided into 5 moving posters that individually and collectively display the name of the essay and author. The background is a pixelated render of Steyerl’s well known film, “November.” Overlaying elements of the posters may seem like arbitrary noise that aligns with the posters’ visual language, but when they are seen as a whole (all five posters side by side), the background form the words “the poor cinema,” which is an important concept throughout Steyerl’s essay.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The posters are then projected onto spaces over extended periods of time as a way to investigate how these messages capture the public’s attention in various contexts.
